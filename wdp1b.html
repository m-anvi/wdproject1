<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Name: Manvi Saxena <br>Age: 17 <br> Grade: 12 </p><hr>
<p>I was born in Dallas, Texas, on February 20, 2000. <br> I have one sibling. Her name
	is Shefali, and she is 14.</br>I live in Bellevue, Washington, with both of my parents, <br>
	my sister, our two dogs, tortoise, and bird. My sister also<br>has a horse, who we keep
	in a barn somewhere between <br>Preston and Issaquah. I am not as into horse-back riding as<br> she is,
	so the horse often slips my mind. I think his name is Ronnie.</p>
